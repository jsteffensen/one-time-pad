# one-time-pad

Generate random keys and encrypt/decrypt data with one time pad with the html file.

Works with mulit-selecting files and running directly off your file system location.

You can make keys with OpenSSL using this command (number at the end is key size):

```openssl rand -out random_10mb.bin 10485760```

Visualize your keys data with NodeJS by running the js file in this repo.
